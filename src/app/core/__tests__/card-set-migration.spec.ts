/**
 * The behavioural baseline for moving the card family off `EQUIP[<nome>]`.
 *
 * `EQUIP[<nome>]` matches a combo partner by its English display name. It is the legacy form
 * (docs/item-json.md §5) and it fails in two directions: a pt-BR rename or an `[Apoio]`-style
 * suffix silently stops the bonus paying, and the client re-issues items under new ids
 * keeping the old English name — so one clause fires for every generation, and rewriting it
 * to a SINGLE id silently drops the others. Nothing errors either way; the set just stops
 * paying for whoever holds the id nobody wrote down.
 *
 * So the rewrite is not trusted, it is measured. `card-set-baseline.json` was written from
 * the database as it stood BEFORE the migration and holds two things per card:
 *
 *   scenarios  what the card grants worn alone with no partner at all, and worn with each
 *              line-up that satisfies a clause — one per alternative of every `||` group, so
 *              a partner generation that exists is a doll that actually ran;
 *   clauses    every set clause as {key, partner ids, the rest of the entry}. The numbers
 *              cannot see this half: a clause naming one generation of a re-issued partner
 *              measures the same as one naming both, because the doll only ever wears the id
 *              that IS named.
 *
 * Regenerate the fixture ONLY to add cards, never to accept a difference:
 *
 *     UPDATE_CARD_SET_BASELINE=1 npx vitest run src/app/core/__tests__/card-set-migration.spec.ts
 *
 * Same method as costume-enchant-combo-migration.spec.ts, which migrated the Visual-enchant
 * stones (159 records, 330 clauses).
