/**
 * Cycle timing for an attack rotation.
 *
 * Per skill: **fixa -> variável** run in sequence, and when the cast ends the
 * **pós-conjuração and the recarga start together**. Pós blocks *every* skill (it is the
 * global cooldown); recarga blocks *only that skill*. On top of that, VelAtq (ASPD) is a
 * floor between actions, measured start-to-start.
 *
 *     start_i   = max(gate, ready[key_i])
 *     castEnd_i = start_i + cast_i
 *     ready[key_i] = castEnd_i + cd_i          // recarga: this skill only
 *     gate      = max(castEnd_i + acd_i,       // pós: every skill
 *                     start_i + aspdPeriod)    // VelAtq floor, start-to-start
 *
 * For a single-skill rotation this collapses to
 * `max(fct + vct + max(acd, cd), 1/aspd)` — exactly `calcSkillAspd`'s own `hitPeriod`
 * capped by ASPD. This module is a generalisation of `utils/calc-skill-aspd.ts`, not a
 * second source of truth, and `rotation-schedule.spec.ts` holds the two together.
 *
 * Waits are **absorbed into the cycle**, both the VelAtq wait and the recarga wait: the
 * rotation idles and the cycle gets longer, which is what makes the order matter at all.
 * A skill's own recarga spanning the cycle boundary is therefore normal, not an error —
 * see {@link RotationCycle.period} for the case that genuinely cannot be drawn.
