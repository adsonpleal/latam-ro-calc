/**
 * The one description of what `tools/build-web-data.mjs` emits.
 *
 * Three things resolve artifacts through `data-manifest.json` and used to each carry their
 * own copy of this: the app (`src/app/api-services/ro.service.ts`), the Worker's MCP data
 * loader (`worker/mcp/data.ts`) and the spec loader (`mcp/src/data/dataset.node.ts`).
 * Same reasoning as `share-path.ts` — when a grammar has three readers, it gets one
 * definition, or two of them drift.
 *
 * Framework-free on purpose: the Worker cannot import from `@angular/core`.
