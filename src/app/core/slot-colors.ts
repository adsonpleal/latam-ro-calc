/**
 * Per-slot highlight colors: the mark a player puts on an equipment card to say
 * "this piece is the build" or "this one is a stand-in". Two halves, stored in
 * two places, because they mean different things.
 *
 * The *assignment* (slot key -> palette id) rides the build model, so it reaches
 * whoever opens a share link or loads a named save — that is the whole point of
 * marking a slot. The *label* a player gives a color is their own vocabulary and
 * stays in their browser (see CalcStorage), so a link never imposes one person's
 * conventions on another's.
 *
 * Framework-free (lives in src/app/core) and structurally typed so it round-trips
 * through JSON and can be validated in unit tests without a DOM.
