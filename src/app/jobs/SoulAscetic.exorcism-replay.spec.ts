/**
 * Soul Ascetic — Exorcizar Assombração (SOA_EXORCISM_OF_MALICIOUS_SOUL, 5425) against the
 * first replay this class ever had.
 *
 * It was written with a residual it could not close, and a second recording closed it:
 * `SoulAscetic.exorcism-gear-states.spec.ts` (card DeZJHbAXb2) gears up on camera, so it
 * has the gearless control and the status window this one lacks. What that file settled is
 * folded in below — the soul count, the enhanced branch, and the two MATK terms — and the
 * three cells that used to be open are now one cell that fits.
 *
 * Ground truth: `fixtures/soa-exorcismo.rrf`, submitted through "Ajude o simulador" and
 * triaged as card bVCSkxTfvj. "ShaktiBell", Asceta das Almas base 223 / job 40, recorded
 * on tra_fild against "Dummy - Médio" (mob 21065, Formless, Neutral 1, boss, MDEF 0).
 * 14 seconds, five casts, nothing else: cast Convocar Almas Lv5, cast Exorcizar
 * Assombração Lv5, repeat. Five damage packets, all `count = 5`:
 *
 *   2.866.465   2.806.720   2.533.250   2.620.710   2.711.250
 *
 * **What this recording settles.**
 *
 *  1. *The formula in `SoulAscetic.ts` is right.* browiki.org/wiki/Exorcizar_Assombração
 *     publishes it in full — "Dano = {[(Dano base) + (Nv. de Maestria com Almas x 2)] +
 *     FEI} x Almas Ativas x (Nv. de base / 100)" — which is character-for-character what
 *     the class computes, and its 150%/250% per level reproduce the client's own table
 *     (750% / 1.250% at Lv5). Two independent sources, no divergence: the `[V2]` label the
 *     skill still carries is, for this one skill, not a liability. Asserted below.
 *  2. *The cast window is right.* The recording's ZC_USE_SKILL puts the cast at **824 ms**;
 *     the engine computes 824,3 ms from fct 1,5 + vct 3 and this build's reduction. That
 *     also validates the imported build's DEX, INT and every VCT% piece on it — an exact
 *     match no wrong loadout survives.
 *  3. *The traits are consistent.* The sender reported FEI 92 and nothing else, and 92 is
 *     exactly the whole trait budget at base 223 (7 at 200, +3 per level, +4 every 5th).
 *     The recording itself carries none: it never leaves tra_fild, so no ZC_COUPLESTATUS.
 *
 * **What it cannot settle, and why.** This is a 14-second single-state recording. It has
 * no ZC_PAR_CHANGE for any status field — only HP (5), SP (7) and AP (232) — so the §3
 * cross-check that normally proves the build before a formula is read off it is simply not
 * available, and there is no gearless control and no second buff state to separate the
 * stages (§9). Two inputs to the damage are unobservable in it:
 *
 *   - **the soul count.** Convocar Almas "atinge o limite máximo de Almas", and this
 *     character has Perícia com Almas Lv5 → 20 souls. But every packet carries `count = 5`,
 *     while both bROWiki and the client say "o número de golpes é igual ao número de Almas
 *     consumidas". **Settled by the other recording: it is 20 souls, and `count` is not the
 *     soul count** — that character's gearless window solves to exactly one (souls, MATK)
 *     pair, 20 souls at MATK 866, while its packets also carry `count = 5`.
 *   - **the enhanced branch.** The 250%-per-level column applies if the target carries
 *     Assombração or the caster stands in a Totem de Tutela. Neither leaves a trace here:
 *     no ground unit is created during the recording, and the status stream only ever
 *     carries the *player's* own EFSTs, never the dummy's. **It was live.** Totem de Tutela
 *     is a ground unit that lasts ~30s (bracketed to the second in the other file), so one
 *     placed before a 14-second recording starts leaves nothing in it, and the fit below
 *     picks that cell and no other.
 *
 * **What actually closed the gap**, all of it measured on the other recording:
 *   - the souls pay **no** MATK. bROWiki's Coletar Alma says "Cada Alma concede ATQM +3"
 *     and the Total Soul dropdown booked it as `x_matk: lv * 3`; the gearless window says
 *     otherwise — its equipment MATK never moves as the gauge fills, and its packets solve
 *     to 866, the status window's own 813 + 54 with no room for another 60. Dropped, and
 *     dropping it is what let this recording's floor fall below its lowest packet;
 *   - **Talismã do Mago** (5420 Lv2, EFST 1358, up for the whole recording) was missing from
 *     the class. It is in now, and its S.ATQM +4 is the last 1,7%: the note this file used
 *     to carry — that it made the near-fitting cell *worse* — was written when the engine
 *     was reading 1,7% high, and the sign flipped when the souls' phantom MATK came out;
 *   - the other active EFSTs: 1053/1061 (Coletar Alma and the soul counter), 1356 Talismã
 *     do Protetor and 157 Kaahi (both HP regen — the periodic 10.685 HP heals every 3 s are
 *     Talismã do Protetor), 1059 Espírito do Golem (DEF), and 802/942/983/984/1084/1085,
 *     the play-time and account EXP/drop counters already dismissed in `nw-mastery-gap`;
 *   - Reencarnação das Almas (+7-25% to all damage) and Mandala das Feras (+S.ATQM): both
 *     missing from the class, but neither is in this character's learned tree.
 *
 * That recording is `sa-exorcismo-gear-states.rrf`, which is exactly the file this note
 * asked for: it changes equipment on camera, re-sends the status window at every piece, and
 * carries a gearless window with the totem on and off.
