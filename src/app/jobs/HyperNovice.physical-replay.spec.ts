/**
 * `hn-physical-matrix.rrf` — "Cafe Underground", Hyper Novice base 240 / job 50, POW 100
 * CON 59, on the training field against the Large dummy (21066). Submitted through
 * "Ajude o simulador" on 14/08/2026.
 *
 * The first community recording that follows the gear-state protocol on its own: it
 * starts with **nothing equipped**, puts the shield on alone, then the weapon, then the
 * rest piece by piece, and finally fires the ultimate — with the status window re-sent at
 * every single change. Every other recording in that batch was a buffed run against real
 * monsters and could not separate a wrong item from a wrong formula.
 *
 * It also covers a build the class had no test for: both existing Hyper Novice replay
 * specs are magic. This one is physical, through Choque Violento (Shield Chain Rush).
 *
 * Two states are worth everything here:
 *
 *  - **shield only.** With no weapon there is no ATK roll, so all nine packets print the
 *    *same* number, 341.560. That is an equation, not a range.
 *  - **full gear, with and without the ultimate.** Same gear either side, so the ratio
 *    between them is the ultimate's multiplier and nothing else.
