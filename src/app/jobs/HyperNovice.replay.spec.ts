/**
 * Hyper Novice — the magic tree checked against `fixtures/hn-magic-lv1.rrf`, recorded on
 * tra_fild on 02/08/2026 by "Asbrun III" against "Dummy - Médio" (monster 21065, Formless,
 * Neutral 1, MDEF 0, soft MDEF 25).
 *
 * The recording is worth four runs in one file. The player casts every magic skill at
 * **level 1**, then strips all 20 pieces of gear (including shadow and costume) and casts
 * them again, then re-equips, casts the ultimate and casts them again, then strips the gear
 * once more. The two bare runs are the ones used here: with no weapon there is no MATK
 * variance, so every packet is a single deterministic number and the comparison is by
 * **equality**, not by range.
 *
 * Character (session snapshot + the traits the player reported):
 *   base level 240, job level 50, class 4307
 *   STR 31  AGI 100  VIT 120  INT 120  DEX 94  LUK 100
 *   SPL 100  WIS 30  STA 29  (POW/CON/CRT at zero)
 *   Self Study Sorcery Lv5; every attack skill cast at Lv1 (the 0x01de packets say so).
 *
 * What it decided:
 *   - the `[V2]` tables (Sigma's blog) were wrong for Hell's Drive, Napalm Vulcan Strike,
 *     Jack Frost Nova's explosion and Ground Gravitation's field. The client description
 *     is right, same verdict as the Night Watch recordings (see [[sigma-v2-vs-client-tables]]);
 *   - Meteor Storm Buster (5455) was missing from the class entirely;
 *   - the ultimate "Anjo da Magia" (5462) multiplies the skill ratio, per skill;
 *   - Self Study Sorcery's "+N% damage" column reaches the repeating damage of a ground
 *     skill but NOT its first hit.

 * The status packets read ATQ Equip. = 100 and ATQM Equip. = 100 with **nothing**

 *
 * Which buff is still open, but the candidates are down to one. The recording's t=0 status
 * list is 673, 802, 942, 983, 984, 461, 1316 and 1409; resolving those ids against
 * rAthena's `efst_type` enum (src/map/status.hpp) gives:
 *   673  EFST_ON_PUSH_CART           the cart being out — no combat effect
 *   802  EFST_PLAYTIME_STATISTICS    playtime tracker — no combat effect
 *   942/983/984  EFST_AID_PERIOD_*   account-period store/drop/exp bonuses
 *   461  EFST_GN_CARTBOOST           Propulsão do Carrinho
 *   1316 EFST_SHIELDSPELL            Aegis Domini — Lv3 is ATQ/ATQM +150, not +100, and it
 *                                    needs a shield, which the bare runs do not have
 *   1409 (unnamed)                   rAthena's enum has a gap at 1404-1414 and the LATAM
 *                                    client's own status-name table skips the range too
 * so 1409 is the only one left that can be carrying it.
 *
 * It is NOT "Poder de Odin": that is EFST_ODINS_POWER = 583, which never appears in the
 * recording. Its Lv2 numbers happen to be ATK +100 / MATK +100 (constants/job-buffs.ts),
 * but it also carries -40 DEF / -40 MDEF, and equip DEF and equip MDEF only reconcile
 * without that penalty (see the geared status describe). So the two positives are injected
 * on their own.
 *
 * Whatever it is, it grants **only** those two flat numbers: the bare runs below are
 * packet-exact with nothing else added, so it carries no magic-damage percentage, no
 * element or size bonus and no S.MATK. That narrows the search a lot. The recording's own
 * inventory holds no consumable that fits either — the Battle Pass items in it are access
 * tokens with no script, and every +100/+100 item in the database is equipment, all of
 * which was removed for these runs.
 *
 * It is a property of this recording, not of the class, which is why it is injected here
 * instead of modelled in HyperNovice.

 * Three skills already do. The rest are short at the top by 3-5%, evenly across elements
 * and both rounds — inverting every packet to the MATK that would have produced it puts the
 * whole distribution ~100 MATK (~5%) above what the build can reach, with a spread that
 * matches the weapon roll (310) to within sampling. So what is missing is one multiplicative
 * magic bonus on the equipment, not a formula: the bare runs are packet-exact with the same
 * skills, and every flat number in the status window above now matches.
 *
 * Ruled out along the way: the weapon has no Enchant Grade (a grade would move refineBonus
 * and SP_MATK1 off 1017, and grade D alone would push status MATK to 929); the target is a
 * boss (Gravitação and Geladinho never land, and both are boss-immune), so the shield's
 * boss clause does apply; matkPercent (44), m_my_element_all (98), m_size_all (19) and
 * m_race_all (2) each sum exactly to their pt-BR descriptions.
